Stayforge provides a lightweight, Key-Value-based data storage solution designed for modules to store configuration and 
business data. Each module is assigned a dedicated Etcd namespace, ensuring data isolation and preventing cross-access 
between modules. You can interact with the service through standard Etcd interfaces, enabling flexible and efficient 
data management.
